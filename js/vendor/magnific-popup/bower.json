But has a small restriction from me - please do not create public WordPress plugin based on it(or at least contact me before creating it), because I will make it and it'll be open source too ([want to get notified?](http://dimsemenov.com/subscribe.html)).\n\nCreated by [@dimsemenov](http://twitter.com/dimsemenov) & [contributors](https://github.com/dimsemenov/Magnific-Popup/contributors).",
