# UI-Prototypes
## HTML/CSS/JS Front-End UI Prototypes

### Front-end Stack:

The stack is designed in an Object Oriented, Modular way, to allow for optimized revisions, updates, testing and scalability. When possible everything has been broken down into smaller bits. Life is much easier this way.

* common desktop and mobile UI components & elements - no need to reinvent the wheel, just restyle it.
* out of the box multi device and browser support
* Sass support

Jekyll
* modular HTML
* all necessary files generate into _site folder

Bower
* package and dependency management
* easily add, remove and update all dependencies

RequireJS
* modular JS FTW!
* call and deliver only what is needed when you need it.
